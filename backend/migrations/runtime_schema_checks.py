"""Runtime checks to ensure critical schema columns exist.

These helpers allow the application to self-heal older SQLite databases that
miss columns introduced by recent migrations.  The production deployment uses
Alembic but on customer instances the database file is sometimes upgraded via
scripts; if one of those steps is skipped the ORM will crash when it tries to
load a column that is missing.  By applying lightweight ``ALTER TABLE``
instructions during start-up we guarantee that the API keeps working while still
printing a clear message in the logs so administrators can follow-up with a
proper migration later.
